# üß† Pok√©mon Classifier (Gen 1)

A deep learning-powered web app that identifies **1st generation Pok√©mon** from an image and displays relevant data like stats, sprite, and cry!

---

## üì¶ Overview

This project uses **transfer learning** with a ResNet-18 model to classify Pok√©mon from uploaded images. After training and fine-tuning, the model is integrated into an interactive **Streamlit** app that:

- Predicts the Pok√©mon species from an uploaded image
- Displays its animated sprite
- Plays its cry sound
- Shows its base stats

## üìä Dataset

### üìà Stats
- **Source**: Scraped from [Pok√©mon Database](https://pokemondb.net)
- Contains HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special, and Total stats for all Gen 1 Pok√©mon.

### üñºÔ∏è Images
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikoajkolman/pokemon-images-first-generation17000-files)
- Images for all 151 Gen 1 Pok√©mon in various styles.

### üîä Cries
- **Source**: [The Sounds Resource](https://www.sounds-resource.com/3ds/pokemonultrasunultramoon/sound/9547/)
- Cry sound files for each Pok√©mon stored in `assets/cries/`.

## üß† Model

- **Architecture**: `ResNet-18` from `torchvision.models`
- **Modifications**:
  - Replaced the final fully-connected layer to output `150` classes (for 150 Pok√©mon images)
- **Training**:
  - Optimizer: `Adam`
  - Loss Function: `CrossEntropyLoss`
  - Accuracy Achieved: **~89%** on test set

---

## üñ•Ô∏è App Functionality

The app is built with **Streamlit** and allows users to:

1. **Upload an image** of a Pok√©mon
2. The model **predicts the species**
3. The app:
   - Displays an **animated sprite** of the predicted Pok√©mon
   - Plays the **cry** sound of that Pok√©mon
   - Shows its **base stats** from the Pok√©dex

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. üìì Open in Google Colab
- Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Click the **GitHub** tab and search `alihuss1017/KantoDex`.
- Open the provided `main.ipynb` notebook

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run All Cells
- The notebook will:
  - ‚úÖ Download the Kaggle Pok√©mon image dataset
  - ‚úÖ Preprocess the data
  - ‚úÖ Fine-tune the pretrained **ResNet-18** model
  - ‚úÖ Evaluate the model on the test set
  - ‚úÖ Launch the **Streamlit app**

> Make sure your runtime is set to **GPU** (under `Runtime > Change runtime type`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

While the KantoDex Classifier performs well within its design scope, there are a few known limitations:

- ‚ùå **Excludes Nidoran‚ôÇ and Nidoran‚ôÄ**: Due to character encoding issues and image/sprite naming inconsistencies, these Pok√©mon were excluded from the dataset.
- üß¨ **Only Supports 1st Generation Pok√©mon**: The model is trained exclusively on the original 150 Pok√©mon, meaning it will not recognize Pok√©mon from later generations..
